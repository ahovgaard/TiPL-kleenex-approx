Dandan:
I added the 'fasta_generate' and 'patterns' directoies:

. fasta_generate: generate random DNA sequence, can be used as patterns or texts for
  our tests. The chromesome files are aslo OK, but they contain both upper and lower
  case characters.

. patterns: the test patterns for all the four tools

Let me know if this has any problems.
