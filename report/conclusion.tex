\section{Conclusion}
As long as the patterns are simple enough so that Kleenex compiles a not too
large executable, it seems to be able to compete with or outperform the other
tools we have tested, with NR-grep being the biggest difference, but it does
have an unfair advantage in using the input with newlines.
